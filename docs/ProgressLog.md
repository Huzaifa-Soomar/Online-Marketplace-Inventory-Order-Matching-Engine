4. Understood realistic problem constraints
5. Identified suitable data structures



Commits: None



Blocked by / Risks:

1. Various matching logics
2. Primary purpose of marketplace (commission -> max matches OR satisfaction -> best matches)
3. Initial ambiguity in project scope and expectations, especially regarding how realistic the marketplace behavior needed to be



Next steps:

1. Problem scope

3. Finalize data structures







#### **Week 2:**

Date: 2025-12-11

Author: Huzaifa Soomar

Phase: Req + Design



Tasks completed:

1. Identified primary data structures
2. Finalized high level design
3. Listed core requirements
